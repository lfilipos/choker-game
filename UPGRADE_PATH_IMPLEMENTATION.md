# Upgrade Path Display Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Frontend Components

#### UpgradePathDisplay Component
- **Location:** `chess-game/src/components/UpgradePathDisplay.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Displays all 6 piece types (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king)
  - Shows upgrade progress for both teams (black on top, white on bottom)
  - 3 pips per piece per team representing 3 upgrade levels
  - Interactive piece icons for selection/communication
  - Hover tooltips showing upgrade details

#### UpgradeTooltip Component
- **Location:** `chess-game/src/components/UpgradeTooltip.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Shows upgrade name, description, cost, and level
  - Displays effects with type-specific coloring
  - Shows requirements with progress tracking
  - Visual indicators for met/unmet requirements

#### Upgrade Progress Utility
- **Location:** `chess-game/src/utils/upgradeProgress.ts`
- **Features:**
  - Calculates pip states: empty, partial, ready, completed
  - Tracks requirement progress (captures, treasury)
  - Maps piece types to upgrade paths
  - Exports helper functions for progress calculation

### 2. Pip States Visual Design

1. **Empty State:** Stroke only + upgrade number in team color
2. **Partial State:** Half-filled with team color, white number
3. **Ready State:** 90% filled with team color, white sliver on right
4. **Completed State:** Fully filled with team color

### 3. Communication System

#### Chess Player → Poker Player
- Chess player clicks piece icon in UpgradePathDisplay
- Emits `set_upgrade_preference` socket event
- Backend tracks preference in team state
- Broadcasts `upgrade_preference_updated` to all players in match

#### Poker Player UI
- CompactStore component receives `requestedPieceType` prop
- Piece sub-tab highlights with gold glow and pulsing animation
- Next available upgrade for requested piece highlights with gold border
- Visual feedback helps poker player prioritize purchases

### 4. Backend Changes

#### matchManager.js
- Added `preferredPieceForUpgrade` field to team state
- Added `setUpgradePreference()` method for toggling selection
- Preference persists in match state

#### server.js
- Added `set_upgrade_preference` socket event handler
- Added `upgrade_preference_updated` broadcast to match players
- Integrated with existing socket architecture

### 5. Styling

#### UpgradePathDisplay.css
- Dark theme matching game aesthetic
- Hover effects and animations
- Selection glow effect with pulse animation
- Responsive pip sizing

#### UpgradeTooltip.css
- Card-based design with shadow
- Color-coded effect types
- Compact layout for chess sidebar

#### CompactStore.css
- Added `.piece-sub-tab.requested` with gold highlighting
- Added `.upgrade-item.next-requested` with gradient background
- Pulsing animations for visual attention

## Integration Points
