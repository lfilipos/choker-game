## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Core Integration Points

#### 1. MovementMechanics Integration
```tsx
// Integrated into ChessGame component
{selectedPiece && gameState.selectedSquare && (
  <MovementMechanics
    selectedPiece={selectedPiece}
    piecePosition={gameState.selectedSquare}
    upgrades={tieredUpgrades}
    board={gameState.board}
    onMoveComplete={handleMovementMechanicsComplete}
    onCancel={handleMovementMechanicsCancel}
  />
)}
```

#### 2. Tiered Upgrade System
```tsx
// Enhanced ChessPieceComponent with tiered indicators
const getUpgradeTiers = () => {
  const tiers = { tier1: false, tier2: false, tier3: false };
  
  pieceTieredUpgrades.forEach(upgrade => {
    if (upgrade.tier === 1) tiers.tier1 = true;
    if (upgrade.tier === 2) tiers.tier2 = true;
    if (upgrade.tier === 3) tiers.tier3 = true;
  });
  
  return tiers;
};
```

#### 3. Visual Indicator System
```tsx
// Tiered upgrade indicators with color coding
{highestTier > 0 && (
  <div className="tiered-upgrade-indicators">
    {upgradeTiers.tier1 && (
      <div className="tier-indicator tier-1" title="Tier 1 Upgrade">
        <span className="tier-number">1</span>
      </div>
    )}
    {/* Tier 2 and 3 indicators */}
  </div>
)}
```

### Component Architecture

```
