# Movement Mechanics - Tiered Upgrade System

This directory contains the new movement mechanics components for the tiered upgrade system, implementing enhanced piece movement capabilities based on upgrade tiers.

## Overview

The movement mechanics system provides enhanced movement options for chess pieces based on their upgrade tier level. Each piece type can gain new movement abilities through the upgrade system, making the game more strategic and engaging.

## Components

### 1. MovementMechanics (Main Container)

- **Features**:
  - Automatically detects applicable movement mechanics
  - Manages state for different movement types
  - Provides unified interface for all movement mechanics
  - **Priority System**: Simple â†’ Medium â†’ Complex mechanics

### 2. Simple Mechanics (Phase 3.1 - COMPLETE âœ…)

- **Purpose**: Enhanced movement patterns for queens (Tier 2+ upgrade)
- **Features**:
  - **Standard Movement**: Traditional queen movement (diagonal + orthogonal)
  - **Extended Movement**: Enhanced range with greater reach
  - **Jump Movement**: Jump over pieces to reach distant squares
  - Jump path selection and visualization

#### KingEnhancedMovement
- **File**: `KingEnhancedMovement.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Royal abilities and strategic movement for kings (Tier 2+ upgrade)
- **Features**:
  - **Standard Movement**: One square in any direction
  - **Enhanced Movement**: Extended range with special abilities
  - **Teleport Movement**: Move to any valid square on the board
  - **Command Movement**: Command other pieces to move in your stead
  - Special ability selection (Shield, Rally, Inspire, etc.)

## Upgrade Requirements

### Simple Mechanics (Tier 1-3)
- **Pawn - Dual Movement (Tier 3)**
  - **Requirement**: Capture 3 pawns
  - **Effect**: Can move two pawns in one turn
  - **Usage**: Select two pawns and their destinations

- **Knight - Adjacent Movement (Tier 1)**
  - **Requirement**: Capture 1 knight
  - **Effect**: Can move to adjacent squares (in addition to L-shaped moves)
  - **Usage**: Select any adjacent square for movement

- **Bishop - Orthogonal Movement (Tier 1)**
  - **Requirement**: Capture 1 bishop
  - **Effect**: Can move horizontally and vertically (in addition to diagonal moves)
  - **Usage**: Choose between diagonal or orthogonal movement, then select destination

### Medium Complexity Mechanics (Tier 2+)
- **Rook - Protection Mechanics (Tier 2)**
  - **Requirement**: Capture 2 rooks
  - **Effect**: Can protect squares and control enemy movement
  - **Usage**: Choose protection mode and select squares to protect/control

- **Queen - Extended Movement (Tier 2)**
  - **Requirement**: Capture 2 queens
  - **Effect**: Enhanced movement patterns including jumping over pieces
  - **Usage**: Select movement type and destination, with jump path selection

- **King - Enhanced Movement (Tier 2)**
  - **Requirement**: Capture 2 kings
  - **Effect**: Multiple movement types with special abilities
  - **Usage**: Choose movement type, special ability, and destination

## Implementation Details

### State Management
Each component manages its own state for:
- Selected pieces/squares
- Movement type selection
- Protection mode selection
- Special ability selection
- Confirmation status

### Event Handling
- `onMoveComplete`: Called when movement is confirmed
- `onProtectionComplete`: Called when protection is confirmed
- `onCancel`: Called when movement is cancelled
- Proper cleanup and state reset on completion

### Priority System
The MovementMechanics container implements a priority system:
1. **Simple Mechanics** (Tier 1-3): Pawn Dual, Knight Adjacent, Bishop Orthogonal
2. **Medium Complexity** (Tier 2+): Rook Protection, Queen Extended, King Enhanced
3. **Future**: Complex Mechanics (Tier 3+)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Responsive button arrangements

## Usage

### Basic Integration
```tsx
import { MovementMechanics } from './movement';

<MovementMechanics
  selectedPiece={selectedPiece}
  piecePosition={piecePosition}
  upgrades={playerUpgrades}
  board={gameBoard}
  onMoveComplete={handleMoveComplete}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
/>
```

### Standalone Components
```tsx
import { RookProtectionMechanics } from './movement';

<RookProtectionMechanics
  piece={rookPiece}
  upgrades={rookUpgrades}
  protectedSquares={availableSquares}
  onProtectionComplete={handleProtection}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
/>
```

## Styling

The components use a consistent dark theme with:
- **Primary Color**: #4CAF50 (Green)
- **Secondary Color**: #2196F3 (Blue)
- **Accent Color**: #9C27B0 (Purple)
- **Warning Color**: #FF9800 (Orange)
- **Background**: #1a1a1a (Dark)
- **Borders**: #444 (Medium Gray)

### CSS Classes
- `.movement-mechanics`: Base container styling
- `.selector-header`: Header section styling
- `.selection-section`: Selection area styling
- `.selector-actions`: Action button styling
- `.selected-summary`: Summary display styling
