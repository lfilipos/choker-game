# 3-Level Tiered Upgrade System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive 3-level upgrade system with sequential prerequisites and team-wide requirements for piece upgrades.

## Changes Made

### Backend

#### 1. Upgrade Definitions (`chess-backend/upgradeDefinitions.js`)
- ✅ Added `level` (1-3) to each upgrade
- ✅ Added `requires` field for prerequisite upgrades
- ✅ Added `requirements` object with:
  - `captures.byType`: Specific piece type capture counts
  - `captures.total`: Total capture requirements
  - `treasuryMin`: Minimum treasury balance requirements
- ✅ Updated all upgrade names, costs, and descriptions per spec
- ✅ Set all upgrades to `activationMethod: 'purchase'`
- ✅ Removed `queen_aura` duration (now permanent)

#### 2. Upgrade Manager (`chess-backend/upgradeManager.js`)
- ✅ Added `isEligible(color, upgradeId, teamStats)` method
  - Checks prerequisite ownership
  - Validates capture requirements (by type and total)
  - Validates treasury minimum
- ✅ Updated `purchaseUpgrade()` to enforce eligibility
- ✅ Updated `getAvailableUpgrades()` to include eligibility info
  - Returns `eligible` boolean
  - Returns `lockedReasons` array for UI display

#### 3. Match Manager (`chess-backend/matchManager.js`)
- ✅ Added `totalCaptures` to team state initialization
- ✅ Increment `totalCaptures` on regular captures
- ✅ Increment `totalCaptures` on siege captures
- ✅ Pass `teamStats` to upgrade manager in `purchaseUpgrade()`

#### 4. Server Handlers (`chess-backend/server.js`)
- ✅ Updated `get_available_upgrades` to pass team stats
- ✅ Updated `purchase_upgrade` handlers to pass team stats
- ✅ Updated all economy update handlers to pass team stats

#### 5. Tests (`chess-backend/upgradeManager.test.js`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for eligibility checks
- ✅ Tests for prerequisite validation
- ✅ Tests for capture requirements (by type and total)
- ✅ Tests for treasury requirements
- ✅ Tests for sequential purchase enforcement

### Frontend

#### 1. Types
- ✅ Extended `UpgradeDefinition` in `types/upgrades.ts` and `types.ts`
  - Added `level`, `requires`, `requirements`
  - Added `eligible`, `lockedReasons`

#### 2. UpgradeStore Component (`components/UpgradeStore.tsx`)
- ✅ Display level badges (Lv.1, Lv.2, Lv.3)
- ✅ Show locked state for ineligible upgrades
- ✅ Display requirement reasons when locked
- ✅ Disable purchase button when not eligible
- ✅ Show appropriate button text (Locked/Insufficient Funds/Purchase)

#### 3. CompactStore Component (`components/CompactStore.tsx`)
- ✅ Display level badges inline with upgrade names
- ✅ Show locked state styling
- ✅ Display requirement text for locked upgrades
- ✅ Update button logic for eligibility

#### 4. Styles
- ✅ Added `.upgrade-level` badge styling (UpgradeStore.css)
- ✅ Added `.upgrade-card.locked` styling
- ✅ Added `.upgrade-requirements` display section

## Upgrade Progression by Piece

### Pawns
1. **Swift Advance** (250) - Move 3 squares on first try | Req: Capture 1 pawn
2. **Extended Reach** (350) - Capture from 2 squares away | Req: Level 1 + Capture 3 pawns
3. **Dual Pawn Movement** (450) - Move two pawns per turn | Req: Level 2 + Capture 5 pawns

### Knights
1. **Nimble Knight** (150) - Move 1 adjacent square then normal move | Req: Capture 1 knight
2. **Grand Leap** (300) - 3-2 L-shape pattern | Req: Level 1 + Capture 3 pieces total
3. **Double Jump** (450) - Move twice per turn (no double capture) | Req: Level 2 + Capture 2 knights

### Bishops

2. **Bishop's Hop** (300) - Jump over one friendly piece | Req: Level 1 + Capture 1 bishop
3. **Royal Protection** (400) - Protect king vs knight | Req: Level 2 + Capture 1 rook & 1 knight

### Rooks

3. **Royal Exchange** (450) - Swap with any friendly rook (400/use) | Req: Level 2 + Treasury ≥ 1250

## Key Features

### Team-Wide Requirements
- All capture requirements are tracked per team (not per player)
- Treasury requirements check team balance
- Upgrades are shared across both players on a team

### Sequential Unlocking
- Level 2 upgrades require Level 1 to be purchased first
- Level 3 upgrades require Level 2 to be purchased first
- Cannot skip levels

### UI Feedback
- Locked upgrades show visual indicators (grayed out, lock icon)
- Requirement progress shown in tooltips (e.g., "Capture 3 pawns (2/3)")
- Level badges clearly show progression path
- Purchase button updates based on eligibility

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing upgrade IDs maintained
- Game state compatible with saves
- All existing upgrade effects preserved

## Testing

Run the backend tests with:
```bash
cd chess-backend
npm test upgradeManager.test.js
```

## Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify captures increment team stats correctly
- [ ] Verify level 1 upgrades can be purchased when requirements met
- [ ] Verify level 2/3 upgrades are locked until prerequisites purchased
- [ ] Verify treasury requirements for king upgrades
- [ ] Verify UI shows level badges correctly
- [ ] Verify locked upgrades display requirement reasons
- [ ] Verify purchase button states (Locked/Can't Afford/Purchase)
- [ ] Verify owned upgrades show as owned in store
- [ ] Verify multiple piece type capture requirements (bishop L3, queen L2)
- [ ] Verify total capture requirements (knight L2)

## Notes

- Pawn Swift Advance moves 3 squares (not 2) per existing implementation
- Queen's Aura is now permanent (no duration limit)
- All upgrades use purchase activation (control zone activation removed)
